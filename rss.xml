            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Withings Aura Review</h1><p>I've long wondered what the fuss is with regards to the trend
of smart alarm clocks that use pre-set light and sound patterns / frequencies
to wake you up. Do they really work? And if so, how effective are they?</p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[I am utterly stunned by this Philips in.sight camera.First off, I wanted to highlight the ease of setting this up.I took it out of the box, connected the power, and put it in the place I wanted it. I then downloaded the app to my iphone, after I entered a few details it asked me to choose my WiFi network and enter the passkey. After you do this a QR code shows up and you hold it infront of the camera and 2 minutes later it was connected to the network.Marvelous - I honestly didn't expect that the process would be so easy.So once it's all set up it's down tow a few things really:Image quality - very good in all light conditions. It automatically switches to night mode when required and it does a great job of showing you everything.Sound - sound quality is OK but it seems to suffer from interference here and there but you can still hear things clearly.Intercom - the built in speaker could be better but it does its job.App - I really like the app, it's easy to use and even without paying for a subscription that saved video and audio every-time motion or sound is detected, it still shows you a saved image. It can also play lullabies.I think if you want to use this to monitor a baby it will work well, personally I have this set up in a garage to monitor an E-Type Jaguar, though rather than the car causing a fuss I'm more worried about someone trying to break in.This is a great device, I'm really impressed by the ease of use and it is built VERY sturdily too. For the money I think Philips have done an amazing job!]]></title>
