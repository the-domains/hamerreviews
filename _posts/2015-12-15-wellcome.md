Hello there!

Who'd have thought it, 2 years into a journey where I decided to create my own site to house my reviews, it actually goes live.

And without a content plan, though I have a lot of content, or any plan really, as I guess it'd defeat the point of TheGrid if I had one - well OK, a content plan might have not gone amiss.

So what are you going to see here, and what should you expect? 

Reviews, mostly of electronics, and hotels and place to stay and go. Possibly other stuff too.

As I implied, this is very much a work in progress - or perhaps it's a journey?
