Bose has created some of the best noise cancelling headphones over the years but these trump them all.

I have always marvelled at Bose's QuietComfort headphones. I've always wanted some too, but let's be honest they are prohibitively expensive. Â£250 for a set of headphones is a lot - especially if you aren't going to get the best sound quality.

"What" I hear you cry. Yep, these aren't the best sounding headphones I've ever owned. The Shure SE-420s beat them easily. So why is this a 5 star product?

Because the Bose QC20i's do exactly what they are supposed to do, perfectly.

You see the Quiet Comfort range is built to block out background noise better than any other headphone out there, and they achieve this perfectly.

Ok, they actually sound pretty damn good too! But I was stunned out how much background noise they filter out - way better than I expected. With music at moderate volumes I can't hear the tube or train at all.

In a car I couldn't hear much noise at all - even at 120MPH on the german Autobahn.

To be honest the battery part isn't even very cumbersome - it sits nicely behind my iphone and doesn't actually make the phone too much bigger.

The earbuds are incredibly comfortable. I have had no issues wearing them for 5 hours plus.

I'm just really impressed at what Bose has done. They weigh very little, and work so well it's stunning. It was a lot of money to spend in one hit,. but I am in no doubt that it was worth it now.
