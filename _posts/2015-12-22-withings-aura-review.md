I've long wondered what the fuss is with regards to the trend
of smart alarm clocks that use pre-set light and sound patterns / frequencies
to wake you up. Do they really work? And if so, how effective are they?

The thing
is, they aren't cheap, in-fact I'd say they are downright expensive, so not
something you're going to buy on a whim.

The
Withings Aura is probably the most advanced one out there, and I was very glad
when given the opportunity to review it. I've long been a fan of the company's
products - including its 'Health Mate' app - I also own their smart scales.

The good
news is that this is as easy to set up as the existing devices - so it only
takes a few clicks on the app and you're off. Once connected you can connect to
the Aura through Wi-Fi - nice and simple.

Setting
an alarm time is easy, go into the app, select the Aura and just add an alarm -
choosing the time you want to be woken and how long you want the process to
last - the default is 20 minutes but I am starting to set it to 10 as I always
wake up earlier into the cycle. It'll then wake you up with a special blue light
and music that gradually gets louder. Pretty nifty.

The
device will also help you sleep - supposedly - by using light frequencies and
sound. The light is a glowing red - like a sunset and you can choose the
brightness and you also have some sounds to choose from. If so inclined you can
use a Spotify playlist - which you'll need Spotify premium for.

Alongside
all this, it'll track noise and light levels so you can check why you've been
woken in the night - maybe it's car headlamps shining into your room or loud
noises - it's nice to be able to check. There's also an add on sleep sensor
that measures even more and uses the data it gathers to wake you at an optimum
time - but that's not something that's part of this package.

So, what
do I think?

Mixed
feelings.

The sleep
program is weird and doesn't help me sleep. I'm photosensitive enough as it is
without having a red light shining into my face as I do, and the sound keep me
up rather than helps me drift off. This being said, I do think there's something
to the red lighting - so I'm trying to not use my phone and just read with the
red light on the sleep program and I think it makes me sleepier. I have no idea
if it's aiding the melatonin release or not though.

The wake
up program on the other hand DOES seem to work. I am waking up earlier into the
wake up cycle than I want, however, I don't feel quite as tired when I wake up.
There does seem to be benefit in waking up more gently - rather than an alarm
ripping me out of my sleep.

It also
functions well as a night light and you can adjust the brightness which is a
nice touch.

I'm
slightly bugged by the fact you can't use this as a nightstand speaker -
playing music from your phone. Weird that they don't have this functionality.

This is a
clever piece of kit, but I don't think it works well enough to warrant 5 stars
vs. the inherent cost.

Perhaps
the sleep sensor would make this a 5 star product - but it pushes the price to
Â£250 at the time of writing. So I'm not sure it's justifiable either.

It's definitely
interesting, and the Aura's integration with the rest of the app is fantastic.
I do believe in the Internet of Things, and this is a serious first attempt to
make a smart alarm clock that uses tech to wake you more gently and monitor
sound/noise/temperature in your bedroom. Just a shame the device seems
intentionally limited at times.
